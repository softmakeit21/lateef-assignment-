When I was younger, I had a fondness for traveling, playing football, watching movies, and indulging in cooking. However, as a student now, my interests have shifted to reading books, browsing the internet, coding, and those are my main hobbies.&#9787</p>
    <blockquote><cite>I used to think that being a student gives you the luxury of doing all the things you want to do but then being a  university student and an AltSchooler has made me see things in a new light, Student life has different shades of shege!!</cite></blockquote>

Outside of formal education settings, I developed a keen interest in exploring the tech industry and its lucrative opportunities. As previously mentioned, while my academic focus is on problem solving â€”I've always been drawn to working with computers. Witnessing young individuals engaged in computer-related tasks has consistently captivated me.&#9786 and that was when my interest for going into tech surfaced..I wanted to be able to make things happen with my computer,i wanted to be able to bring my ideas to life

    <h2>Life as an AltSchooler</h2><hr>
  I discovered Altschool after watching one of Layi Wasabi's comedy sketches. Intrigued, I visited their website and was immediately drawn to their system, sparking a strong desire to join their team. Before encountering Altschool, I had been actively coding and developing webpages, showcased here. Seeking to refine my skills and gain a more professional touch to become a top-tier programmer, I applied through their registration portal. Fortunately, I excelled in the entrance examination, confirming my admission into the School of Engineering, specifically pursuing Front End Engineering.
    <p>The school is online based and as the name implies, it is an alternative approach to learning..it has over 10,000 students accross all countries from the world and the school is divided into three as at when i applied and my school which is school of engineering is further divided into three tracks which are basically;
      <blockquote>
       <cite><ul>
        <li>Frontend Engineering</li>
        <li>Backend Engineering</li>
        <li>Cloud Engineering</li>
       </ul></cite>
      </blockquote>
